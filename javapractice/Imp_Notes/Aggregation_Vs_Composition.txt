Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. Example: Class (parent) and Student (child). Delete the Class and the Students still exist.
Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Example: House (parent) and Room (child). Rooms don't exist separate to a House.

Composition Example:
We should be more specific and use the composition link in cases where in addition to the part-of relationship between Class A and Class B - there's a strong lifecycle dependency between the two, meaning that when Class A is deleted then Class B is also deleted as a result


Aggregation Example:
It's important to note that the aggregation link doesn't state in any way that Class A owns Class B nor that there's a parent-child relationship (when parent deleted all its child's are being deleted as a result) between the two. Actually, quite the opposite! The aggregation link is usually used to stress the point that Class A instance is not the exclusive container of Class B instance, as in fact the same Class B instance has another container/s.
