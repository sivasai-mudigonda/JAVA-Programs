/*
A Beautiful String is one that is defined as having two (or more) consecutive characters.
"FUZZY", "FOOTBALL", "BALLET" are all considered to be beautiful strings.
Your job is to try to make all Strings beautiful by removing characters.
You also want to change the original String as little as possible.

Write a method that takes any String and returns the minimum number of character you have to
remove in order to make it beautiful. Return -1 if its not possible.

Exam==>ples:
"AA"
returns 0. Its beautiful just the way it is.

"ABA"
returns 1. You need to remove the B

"ABCDABA" ==> ABCDABA =>1

"ABCDBA" ==> ABBA ==> 2
